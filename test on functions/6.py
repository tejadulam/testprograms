"""The US Constitution says you must be a natural born citizen *and* at least 35 years old. Write a function "can_run_for_president" which takes two arguments `age` and `is_natural_born_citizen` and check if the person is  eligible to run for president in the US?
Test Scenarios:
	print(can_run_for_president(19, True))
	print(can_run_for_president(55, False))
	print(can_run_for_president(55, True))"""
